# The purpose of this branch is to trigger a sysroot update.

At the moment the trigger cannot be run on Travis CI server because its QEMU user emulator is too old to chroot into Ubuntu 16.04 LTS arm64 sysroot.

## History:
- 2016-06-24 - trigger sysroot update for Xenial Xerus cloud image daily build
